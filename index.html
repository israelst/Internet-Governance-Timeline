            <p><strong>Visualizing</strong> the playing field</p>
        </header>
        <p>Already a pressing global issue, internet governance is growing in importance in international debates. With internet governance debates taking place across a range of forums, this visual timeline was developed in an effort to better focus civil society advocacy efforts by understanding where main discussions about global internet governance are taking place. This timeline aims to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>identify forums where internet governance is being discussed/decided over the next few years; and </li>
            <li>identify avenues for participation for civil society to influence those processes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The landscape is divided into several processes, including those falling under: the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) review, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), and the processes related to the governance of internet’s technical resources. Main events related to these processes are then weaved around two particular forums – the ITU Plenipotentiary in 2014 and the WSIS +10 review event in 2015, which were taken as framing references and provisional end points for the mapping.</p>
        <p>NB: This is a work in progress. Additional processes and extension of the endpoint beyond 2014 is planned as the timeline gets developed, and more information becomes available.</p>
